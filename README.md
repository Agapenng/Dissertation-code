This script performs a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of two Alzheimer's disease gene expression datasets (GSE5281 and GSE48350) from GEO. It identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs), visualizes results, applies machine learning models for classification, and performs pathway/network analysis.
